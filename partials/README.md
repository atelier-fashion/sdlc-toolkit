# Partials

This directory holds shared shell snippets that are referenced from multiple
SKILL.md files. Each partial is a small, self-contained POSIX shell script
(`#!/bin/sh`, no bashisms). Keeping these snippets in one place ensures that
updates land everywhere consistently and that each SKILL.md stays focused on
its own instructions rather than re-implementing shared boilerplate.

## Two invocation models

Partials come in two flavors. **Don't mix them up** — the calling convention
differs and so does what kind of partial you should add.

### 1. Executable partial (emits text to stdout)

The partial is a script Claude Code's `!`...`` macro runs and substitutes its
stdout into the skill prompt. Skills invoke it like:

```
!`sh .adlc/partials/<name>.sh 2>/dev/null || sh ~/.claude/skills/partials/<name>.sh`
```

Prefer this form only when the partial has to *compute* something. A partial
that only prints a file is better written at the call site as the `test`/`cat`
chain the ethos block uses (see conventions.md "Ethos"): a host that classifies
what a preamble could have read treats `sh <file>` as opaque — Teton Code pins
the session to its local tier on it (BUG-218) — while `cat <file>` is provably
in reach. `ethos-include.sh` is kept for vendored copies that still call it.

The consumer-project-first fallback works whether or not `/init` has been run
in the consumer repo. This form needs **no** `[ -f ]` guard: `sh <file>` is an
ordinary command, so an absent repo-local copy fails with exit 127 and the `||`
arm runs normally. Model 2 below is the one that has to be guarded, because `.`
is a POSIX special built-in and a failed `.` is fatal under `sh` (REQ-610).

### 2. Sourceable partial (defines a function)

The partial defines a shell function and is sourced (with `.`, the POSIX
equivalent of `source`) into the calling skill's bash block. The function is
then called and its return code or exported variables drive the skill's
behavior. Examples:

- `delegate-gate.sh` — defines `adlc_delegate_gate_check` returning 0/1/2.
  Companion `delegate-gate.md` documents the return-code registry.
- `forge.sh` — the forge-neutral PR-operation adapter (REQ-520). Defines
  `adlc_forge_pr_{create,ready,edit,view,list,merge,comment}` plus
  `adlc_forge_provider` (GitHub/Azure DevOps, `auto` origin-URL detection). The
  single home of `gh`/`az` PR commands; skills never call `gh pr` ops directly
  (lint-enforced). Companion `forge.md` documents the op contract, the normalized
  result/error vocabulary, and the ADO REST-via-PAT fallback.
- `emit-step-telemetry.sh` — defines `_adlc_emit_step_telemetry` (the
  `/analyze` per-step telemetry resolve-and-emit). Companion
  `emit-step-telemetry.md` documents the caller-env contract and the
  call-site protocol: the source line and the `_adlc_emit_step_telemetry`
  call MUST live in the **same fenced block** (SKILL.md fenced blocks do not
  share shell state across steps), which is non-obvious enough to need the
  `.md` (the `delegate-gate.md` precedent). It **self-sources**
  `delegate-tools-path.sh`, so call sites do NOT separately source the
  `$DELEGATE_TOOLS` resolver — sourcing this one partial both resolves
  `$DELEGATE_TOOLS` and defines the function.
- `conflict-bound.sh` — the checkable bound on runner conflict resolution
  (BUG-207). Defines `adlc_conflict_append_only <worktree>` (0 = every
  conflicted file is an append-point collision of self-contained blocks: with
  diff3 markers, every hunk's base section is empty AND each side is
  independently `{}`/`[]`/`()`-balanced; 1 = not, offenders on stdout with one
  reason each on stderr; 2 = nothing to classify or not a worktree — a caller
  bug, never a pass), `adlc_conflict_sides_balanced <file>` (the balance half
  on one diff3-marked file, no git needed), `adlc_conflict_keep_both
  <worktree>` (resolves by keeping both sides in order, re-checks the bound
  first and refuses otherwise, stages the result, records each side's lines in
  a sidecar), and `adlc_conflict_verify_kept <worktree> [<sidecar>]` (proves
  every contributed line survived — the resolution is verified against the
  sidecar, not trusted; it is a line-preservation proof, not a syntactic one).
  The balance check exists because an empty base section does not make git's
  region a whole syntactic unit — it can end mid-construct with the shared
  `}` after `>>>>>>>`, and keep-both then leaves the first side's block open
  with every contributed line still present (LESSON-646, teton-code). The
  bound still does not prove the result compiles; the project's build does.
  Proven against positive, negative, mixed, the `run.sh`-harness-list, the
  mid-construct/slid/bracket, and the wrap-in-block fixtures in
  `tests/conflict-bound.test.sh`; the contract lives in
  `agents/pipeline-runner.md` "Bounded resolution".
- `id-alloc.sh` — collision-safe id allocation with the **remote** as source of
  truth (REQ-518). Defines `adlc_alloc_id <kind>` (prints `max(local,remote)+1`
  and fast-forwards the local counter — which is a cache, not an authority),
  `adlc_remote_high <kind>` (the remote high-water, 0 if none/unreachable), and
  the kind mappers `adlc_id_kind_{counter,lockdir,prefix,scan}` /
  `adlc_id_list_max`. One helper parameterized by `kind` (req|bug|lesson)
  replaces the near-identical inline blocks in `/spec`, `/bugfix`, `/wrapup`.
  Allocation runs inside the existing `mkdir`-lock with its symlink/TOCTOU
  guards intact. The contract (same-fenced-block source-then-call, the
  subshell-`exit` guard) lives in the partial's header comment rather than a
  separate `.md`.
- `id-recheck.sh` — pre-push / PR-time id collision recheck (REQ-518 BR-4/BR-8).
  Defines `adlc_recheck_id <kind> <ID>` returning 0 (no collision on any
  reachable remote, OR degraded-unreachable — never invents a collision from
  absence of data), 1 (collision — prints the exact `adlc renumber` halt to
  stderr), or 2 (usage error). It is a separate partial from `id-alloc.sh` so
  recheck call sites don't load the full allocation machinery, but it sources
  `id-alloc.sh` for the kind mappers + `adlc_remote_high` (one derivation
  surface). Never blocks on the network. Contract in the header comment.
- `intake.sh` — unstructured-source intake for `/spec` Step 1.4 (REQ-594).
  Defines six functions:
  - `adlc_intake_detect <args>` — the activation gate. Returns **0** to run
    intake, **1** for an ordinary feature request. Intake activates only on an
    explicit `--intake` flag, an argument resolving to a readable file path, or
    an argument over 25 lines, so the common one-line-request path is unchanged
    and adds no prompts and no latency. Exports `ADLC_INTAKE_KIND`
    (`transcript` | `notes` | `ticket` | `prose`), `_PATH`, `_REASON`, and
    `_INLINE`. Input pasted inline (BR-1's over-25-lines trigger) carries no path,
    so it is materialized to a temp file — `_PATH` is always a real file on the
    intake path, which is what lets every later step be uniformly file-based.
  - `adlc_intake_segment <path>` — splits the source into labelled 200-line
    segments and writes the delimited corpus handed to the delegate. Returns
    **0** ok, **2** unreadable, **3** **over budget**. The budget is 40 segments
    / **8000 lines**; over it the function *refuses*, naming the actual size,
    and never truncates — a partial read would report zero gaps precisely
    because the unread remainder is invisible. Only the source's **basename**
    is embedded in the corpus. Exports `_SEGMENTS`, `_LINES`, `_CORPUS`,
    `_SOURCE`.
  - `adlc_intake_range <segment-number> <total-lines>` — prints `<start> <end>`
    so a segment the delegate omitted can be read directly from the original.
    Deliberately **stateless** (both values are arguments, not exports):
    reconciliation runs in a different fenced block than segmentation, and
    fenced blocks share no shell state, not even exported variables.
  - `adlc_intake_redact <path>` — the 5-pattern credential chain, in place.
  - `adlc_intake_cleanup <corpus> <source>` — removes intake's own temp artifacts.
    The deletion guards (non-empty path, real temp root, exact `inline-request.txt`
    basename) live in the partial rather than at call sites, because
    `rm -rf "$(dirname "$VAR")"` in a SKILL.md becomes `rm -rf .` the moment `VAR`
    is empty. A user-supplied source file is never deleted.
  - `adlc_intake_sections` — the gap checklist, derived from the requirement
    template rather than hardcoded, minus the headings that are *outputs* of
    intake rather than inputs to it: `Description`, `Assumptions`,
    `Open Questions`, `Retrieved Context`, and `Provenance`.

  Contract in the header comment. Tested by `tests/intake.test.sh` under both
  bash and zsh.

Skills invoke a model-2 partial like:

```bash
if [ -f .adlc/partials/<name>.sh ]; then . .adlc/partials/<name>.sh; else . ~/.claude/skills/partials/<name>.sh; fi
adlc_<name>_function; result=$?
```

Capture `$?` immediately — every subsequent command clobbers it.

The `if`/`else` guard is not decoration and there is exactly **one** accepted
spelling of it. `.` is a POSIX special built-in, so a *failed* `.` makes a
non-interactive shell exit outright: the retired
`. <local> 2>/dev/null || . <canonical>` never reached its fallback under `dash`
or macOS `/bin/sh` — the block just died, and the `2>/dev/null` made it silent
(REQ-610). `command .` does not fix it (macOS `/bin/sh` still exits) and
`[ -f A ] && . A || . B` does not either: it sources the canonical copy *on top
of* the repo-local one whenever the repo-local copy's last command returns
non-zero, inverting the repo-local-first precedence. `tools/lint-skills`'
`unguarded-source` check rejects every spelling but the one above; the full
reasoning is in conventions.md "Bash in skills".

## When does a partial need a companion `.md`?

Add a `<name>.md` alongside the `<name>.sh` when the partial has a public
contract that callers must honor (a return-code registry, an exported-variable
schema, an emit-format spec, or any "must do this when calling me" rule). Pure
text-emitting partials like `ethos-include.sh` don't need one — `cat ETHOS.md`
is its own contract. Function-exporting partials almost always need one,
because the call-site protocol is non-obvious. `delegate-gate.md` is the
canonical example.

## Adding a new partial

- Keep partials POSIX-only (no bashisms, no GNU-specific flags).
- Add new partials sparingly — each one is a shared dependency that touches
  multiple skills. Avoid an aggregator file (`lib.sh`) until there are more
  than five partials; that's YAGNI today.
- Update `/init` if the partial needs to be copied into consumer projects'
  `.adlc/partials/` (the existing `partials/*.sh` copy step covers that).
- Update `/template-drift` if the partial is one consumer projects might
  customize and you want drift detection. Partial drift detection IS
  implemented: `/template-drift` Step 3 ("Detect Partial Drift") diffs each
  `~/.claude/skills/partials/*.sh` against the consumer's `.adlc/partials/`
  copy and classifies it `synced` / `stale` / `missing` (no
  intentional-customization escape hatch — any partial drift is reported as
  `stale` by design, since a modified gate/ethos partial is the threat model
  the check exists to catch).
