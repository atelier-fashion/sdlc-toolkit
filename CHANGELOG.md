# Changelog

All notable changes to the **adlc-toolkit** are documented here.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). This
project follows a **semver-flavored, epoch-based** scheme:

- **MAJOR** — a product *epoch*: an identity or platform shift that changes what the
  toolkit fundamentally is.
- **MINOR** — a feature drop: new skills, pipeline phases, or capabilities (typically
  one or more landed `REQ-*`).
- **PATCH** — fixes, docs, and bookkeeping (reserved going forward; in this
  back-populated history such commits are folded into the minor they shipped with).

This history was back-populated from git on 2026-06-08. Each version is an annotated
tag pointing at the last commit of its release; pure-bookkeeping commits (ID counters,
"mark complete") are folded into their feature's release. `#N` references are GitHub
PRs (`atelier-fashion/adlc-toolkit`).

**The five epochs:**

1. **1.x — SDLC toolkit** — the original SDLC skill pipeline.
2. **2.x — ADLC** — rebrand SDLC → ADLC; tag-based retrieval and cross-repo support.
3. **3.x — Portable toolkit** — genericized for external use via a config seam + presets.
4. **4.x — Kimi delegation** — Kimi K2.5 token-offload tooling, delegation telemetry,
   and the Dynamic-Workflows / multi-human-coordination era.
5. **5.x — Works anywhere** — provider-agnostic delegation, one-command install +
   `adlc doctor`, configurable agent tiers, collision-safe multi-user ids, and the
   GitHub/Azure DevOps forge adapter: the toolkit stops assuming its author's machine.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Every context preamble stays inside Teton Code's shell grammar (BUG-220).**
  BUG-218 took the interpreter out of the ethos line, and the line still pinned
  the session — with every other `## Context` preamble in every skill — because
  the REQ-614 grammar rejects a command before it looks at the verb when it
  contains quoting, redirection, a glob, `$`, or a brace: `|| echo "…"`,
  `2>/dev/null`, `.adlc/specs/*/requirement.md` and `--format="…"` were each
  enough. All seventeen skills' preambles are rewritten inside the grammar —
  bare `echo` messages, no redirects, no globs, no `~/` template fallbacks
  (`/init` vendors `.adlc/templates`), no `| head`/`| tail`/`| grep` (a reader
  with no file is scored as a read of the whole root), `git diff-tree --stat`
  plus `git status --short` in place of `git diff main --stat`,
  `git for-each-ref` in place of a counted `git branch --list` glob, `which gh`
  in place of `command -v`, and sprint reading each `pipeline-state.json` it
  lists instead of `cat`ing them in a `while` loop. `conventions.md` now states
  the grammar. `/canary`'s `gcloud` lines and `/template-drift`'s toolkit
  listing are the documented exceptions: those pin by nature. Teton Code learns
  `git worktree` and `git for-each-ref` as name-only verbs in the same change
  set.

- **The ethos block reads only the project's vendored `ETHOS.md`, with no
  interpreter (BUG-218).** Every skill opened with
  `` !`sh .adlc/partials/ethos-include.sh … || sh ~/.claude/skills/partials/ethos-include.sh` ``.
  Under a host that classifies what a preamble could have read — Teton Code's
  REQ-614/619 grammar — `sh <file>` is opaque by verb and a `~/…` fallback is an
  out-of-root path it cannot prove, so typing *any* toolkit skill pinned the session
  to the local tier (liftably since REQ-619, permanently and silently before
  BUG-214). The block is now
  `` !`test -s .adlc/ETHOS.md && cat .adlc/ETHOS.md || echo "No ethos found — run /init …"` ``:
  the REQ-416 H1 empty-file fallthrough kept, every token in reach, and the
  toolkit-copy fallback dropped — `/init` has vendored `.adlc/ETHOS.md` since
  REQ-416 and `/template-drift` keeps it current, so the fallback only ever served
  a project that had not been initialised, which no skill supports anyway.
  `partials/ethos-include.sh` stays for vendored skill copies that predate the
  line; `conventions.md` and `partials/README.md` say why neither it nor a `~/`
  path may return to a call site.

- **The keep-both bound checks that each side is a whole block, not just that both
  sides only added (BUG-207 follow-up, LESSON-646 in teton-code).** "Every hunk's
  base section is empty" proved both sides purely appended; it did not prove git's
  conflict region was a whole syntactic unit. REQ-614's Phase-7 rebase showed the
  gap live: two REQs each added a method pair before the same following method in
  `harness/tools/mod.rs`, the region ended mid-construct with the shared `    }`
  after `>>>>>>>` as common context, and a keep-both closed only the second side's
  method. `adlc_conflict_verify_kept` would have passed — every contributed line
  *was* present. Line preservation and syntactic validity are different properties.
  `partials/conflict-bound.sh` now refuses the bound at any hunk where a side leaves
  a `{`/`[`/`(` open or closes one it did not open (`adlc_conflict_sides_balanced`,
  folded into `adlc_conflict_append_only`; offending paths still on stdout, and now
  one reason per path on stderr). The contract comment and `agents/pipeline-runner.md`
  "Bounded resolution" say what the bound proves — concatenation cannot change
  nesting — and what it does not: that the result compiles. That remains the
  project build's job on the pushed tip. Fixtures: the mid-construct shape, the
  slid-onto-closing-line shape, brackets, a stray `=======` outside a hunk, and a
  real git merge where one side wraps existing lines in a new block (base-empty,
  so the old bound would have moved the other side's line inside the wrap).

## [5.2.0] — 2026-09-03

The **governance drop** — the toolkit stops trusting itself. Delegation opt-in resolves
in one place and fails closed (REQ-603, REQ-609, BUG-205/206/208/209/213); ids are
reserved on the remote before they are handed out and the namespace survives a worktree
(REQ-545, REQ-546, BUG-210); the pipeline specifies the tests that prove each rule, a bug
names the requirement that shipped it, and `/spec` takes a transcript (REQ-593/594/595);
the merge adapter verifies outcomes instead of trusting exit codes (BUG-150/195/201);
partial sourcing survives POSIX `sh` (REQ-610); and an unattended runner's permission to
resolve a conflict is bounded to what a machine can check, and recorded (BUG-207, BUG-212).
Ten REQs and seventeen bugs, 2026-07-23 → 2026-09-03; every bug filed in the range is
resolved. `v5.1.0` was tagged retroactively the same day at its drop's last commit
(`df5e747`, 2026-06-12) — see that section, reconciled below to match the tag.

### Added

- **BR→verification obligations (REQ-595).** The pipeline audited tests but never
  *specified* them: `/architect` broke a REQ into tasks, `task-implementer` wrote
  whatever tests it judged appropriate, and `test-auditor` reported on coverage
  afterwards — nothing between the Business Rules and the diff ever stated *which*
  rule was proven by *what*. LESSON-330 named the resulting failure (a numbered BR
  implemented as zero, caught only by the Phase-5 panel, or not at all). This moves
  the mapping upstream:
  - `/architect` gains **Step 4.5**, emitting a `## Verification` block per task —
    a `rule | kind | artifact | benign_path` table naming every BR and AC that task
    discharges and the concrete artifact that proves each one. Numbered 4.5 rather
    than renumbering Steps 5–7, which REQ-483/484 cite by number.
  - `kind` resolves **surface-first**: a task whose files are all `*.md` maps to
    `structural-check` (markdown skills have no test runner — their real
    verification is a `tools/lint-skills` check, not a lesser substitute for one);
    any other surface maps to `test-case`, with the artifact shape read from that
    repo's `.adlc/config.yml` `stack:` when present, else its observed test layout.
    No framework name is written into the skill, and the absent-config branch is
    silent rather than an error — which matters because the dogfooding repo has no
    `config.yml` and would otherwise reach the rule only through a failure path.
  - Every emitted row is validated **before write, regardless of origin**: the rule
    ordinal must exist in the parent REQ, the artifact is rejected on `..` then
    charset-validated, and `kind` is checked against the closed enum. Dropped rows
    are reported — a silent drop is indistinguishable from a rule that was never
    mapped, which is the failure the step exists to make visible.
  - `/validate` gains three checks over the task set. Unmapped **BR *and* AC** ids
    and detector rules missing a benign path are reported as **advisory** warnings
    (ACs are gated on the same footing as BRs — they do not reduce to business
    rules, so gating BRs alone would leave half the omission class open). A REQ with
    zero numbered BRs passes with a notice rather than having rules invented for it.
  - `templates/task-template.md` gains the section, **optional by design** so the
    157 task files already on disk stay valid.
- **Unstructured-source intake for `/spec` (REQ-594).** `/spec` assumed its input was
  already a coherent feature request; its only concession to ambiguity was a prose line
  telling it to "ask clarifying questions", with no artifact and no gate. Real
  requirements arrive as meeting notes, chat transcripts, and ticket dumps, and the
  operator compressed them by hand before `/spec` ever ran — so whatever was lost in that
  compression was invisible. New **Step 1.4** turns such a source into a draft REQ plus a
  classified **gap list**, checked section by section against the requirement template:
  - Each gap is `blocking` (no faithful spec without the answer) or `assumption` (the
    spec can proceed under a stated one). Interactively, blocking gaps halt before the
    spec is written; assumption gaps are written verbatim into Assumptions. The gap list
    lives in the spec rather than a separate `gaps.md` (ADR-4).
  - Activation is deliberately narrow — an explicit `--intake` flag, a readable file
    path, or input over 25 lines — so the ordinary one-line request path is untouched:
    no added prompts, no added latency, no `## Provenance` section.
  - The source is **segmented before delegation and reconciled after**, with any segment
    the delegate omitted read directly. Over an 8000-line budget the step **refuses**,
    naming the size, rather than truncating — a silently truncated read reports zero gaps
    precisely because the unread remainder is invisible.
  - Placed before Step 1.5 (a distilled statement is better retrieval-tag input than a
    raw transcript) and before Step 2 (an interactive halt must not burn a REQ id from
    the shared machine-global counter).
  - New `partials/intake.sh` (6 sourceable functions) and `partials/tests/intake.test.sh`
    (116 assertions, run under both bash and zsh).
  - **Not yet proven:** the interactive halt and the subagent non-interactive path are
    SKILL.md control flow, which no unit test reaches — they need a real `/spec --intake`
    run against a transcript before this is trusted end to end.
- **Incident→REQ attribution (REQ-593).** A bug and the REQ that caused it stop being
  unrelated artifacts. `partials/attribution.sh` derives the edge from history the repo
  already carries: blame the root-cause lines, read the blamed commit, extract an attested
  REQ id, validate it against the primary repo's spec directory. `/bugfix` Phase 2 records
  the result on the bug (`introduced_by`, `attribution` — both optional and additive on
  `templates/bug-template.md`), and `/status` gains an **Incident Attribution** section
  answering "which shipped REQs have produced incidents?".

  Three decisions carry the feature. **The commit body is read, not just the subject**:
  `git blame --porcelain` exposes only `summary`, which is the subject alone — measured on
  this repo, a subject-only read finds 37 of the 75 commits carrying provenance and
  silently loses 51% of available attributions. **TASK→REQ resolution is scoped to the REQ
  named in the same commit**: `TASK-001*.md` matches 16 of the 157 task files on disk, so
  an unscoped glob would return unrelated REQs and manufacture a false multi-candidate
  halt. **The reverse edge is derived, never stored** — REQ→incidents is recomputed by
  scanning `.adlc/bugs/` frontmatter, because a backlink written into a spec rots silently
  when an artifact moves or is renumbered.

  Attribution refuses rather than guesses: two or more surviving candidates are presented
  for the operator to choose from (one *or more* — a defect can genuinely emerge from
  several merged REQs), a trailer citing a REQ with no spec directory is dropped, and a bug
  with no derivable REQ records `attribution: none` and continues rather than halting.
  `partials/tests/attribution.test.sh` pins every case under bash, zsh, and sh against BSD
  `/usr/bin/grep`.

- **`--version` / `-V` on the delegation CLIs (REQ-553).** `adlc-read`,
  `adlc-write`, and `extract-chat` report the toolkit version, and the two
  delegate-calling CLIs additionally print the *resolved* provider — `base_url`,
  `model`, the `api_key_env` **name**, and `enabled` — through the same resolver
  a real call uses, so "which endpoint is this install actually talking to?" is a
  one-command answer instead of a config-file + environment + source read. The
  API key **value** is never read or printed. The flag is scanned out of argv
  before parsing (so it needs no other arguments — `adlc-write --version` works
  without `--spec`/`--target`), makes no network call, and works with no key, no
  config file, and no `openai` SDK installed; a config that fails to resolve
  degrades to a single `config_error:` line and still exits 0. The output is a
  stable `key: value` contract, so a future `adlc doctor` can consume it without
  parsing prose. Documented in `tools/delegate/README.md`.

  **Hardened in the same REQ:** the resolved `api_key_env` is checked against an
  `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` allow-list (not just a key-family blocklist) at the end of
  the cascade, so a key pasted into the higher-precedence
  `ADLC_DELEGATE_API_KEY_ENV` override — or a vendor prefix the blocklist never
  heard of — is refused instead of printed; `base_url` userinfo is redacted to
  `***@host` on the print path only; the argv scan is value-aware, so `-V` in an
  option's value position is no longer mistaken for a version request; the
  repo root is validated as a real toolkit checkout, so a copy vendored inside
  another git repo reports its own version rather than the host's; and only the
  first line of `VERSION` is read, bounded, so it cannot forge extra output
  lines. A follow-up audit round closed the residuals: the parsers now refuse
  prefix abbreviations, so the pre-parse scan's exact-spelling option sets are
  provably complete (`--sp "--version"` no longer hijacks the version path);
  every value interpolated into the report is collapsed to one line with control
  characters stripped, so a newline in a model name or `VERSION` file cannot
  forge an `enabled:` line; the repo root is validated by *identity* rather than
  marker-file existence, so an outer checkout containing a vendored inner copy
  no longer wins; AWS access-key IDs (`AKIA`/`ASIA`/… ) are refused as
  `api_key_env` despite being valid `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`; URL redaction is
  fail-closed, stripping userinfo syntactically before parsing so a malformed
  URL can never print its password; and the privacy notice now names the
  resolved endpoint host, so a hijacked `base_url` is visible at the moment file
  contents leave the machine.


- **Atomic remote id reservation at allocation time (REQ-546).** `adlc_alloc_id` now
  *reserves* a candidate number on `origin` before returning it, by pushing a
  lightweight `refs/adlc/ids/<kind>/<NNN>` ref at a distinct commit object — first
  writer wins, because a second push of a different object is rejected
  non-fast-forward. Adds `adlc_reservation_nonce`, `adlc_reserve_id`, and
  `adlc_remote_reservation_nums`; wires the reservation namespace into
  `adlc_remote_high` as a **third independent source** alongside the existing two, so
  a number in flight on another machine is visible before it has any artifact; and
  adds a bounded reservation-retry loop inside the existing lock. Push outcomes are
  classified empirically — `won` / `race` / `policy` / `transport` — rather than by
  exit code. `assume` becomes a fourth, per-repo-scoped id kind (counter, lockdir,
  artifact path, scan, single-repo derivation). The refspec uses brace form to avoid
  the zsh `:r` modifier hazard (LESSON-335).

- **REQ id pre-push recheck wired into `/proceed` (REQ-545).** `/proceed` had no
  `adlc_recheck_id` call site, so a REQ id allocated by `/spec` could become a pushed
  `feat/REQ-xxx` branch on a second machine with no pre-push remote re-verification —
  the REQ-518 BR-4 gap, open for the REQ kind only. The recheck now runs as a labeled
  sub-block in Step 0 item 4, after the origin fetch and before worktree registration.
  An exact-full-branch-name `ls-remote` probe provides the BR-3 self-exemption so the
  pipeline does not halt on its own footprint during resume or crash recovery; a
  same-id different-slug branch, or a merged artifact, still halts with the renumber
  instruction. Degraded remotes proceed, per the partial's existing contract.

- **Three specs drafted from the Cerebro ADLC comparison (REQ-593, REQ-594, REQ-595).**
  Artifacts only when drafted — all three were `status: draft`, and each carried an
  adversary report with verdict *found problems* and unresolved critical/major
  findings. `REQ-593` would attribute a BUG to the REQ that shipped its cause by
  walking `git blame` → commit trailer → TASK → REQ; `REQ-594` would add an intake
  step to `/spec` that turns unstructured input into a draft plus a classified gap
  list with a gate. **REQ-595 has since shipped** — see its entry above; its adversary
  findings (F7–F10) were closed in the spec before implementation. REQ-593 and REQ-594
  remain drafts: listed here because the specs are in the tree, not because the
  behavior is.

### Changed

- **A real config parser behind a strict schema, and shell resolution that never
  consults shell state (REQ-609).** ⚠️ **Re-run `install.sh --with-delegation`, and
  read the refusal table below if you keep a hand-edited config.**

  REQ-603 made Python the sole authority over whether your source files leave the
  machine — which made `parse_delegate_config`, a hand-written flat reader, that
  authority. Four adversarial passes then found **nine distinct fail-opens** in it,
  six of them introduced by the pass that rewrote it under a tests-first,
  mutation-proven discipline. A comment on the `delegate:` header defeated it. A
  nested mapping hoisted `enabled: true` over a written `false`. A second
  `delegate:` block was unreachable. The discipline proved what its author tested;
  it could not reach what its author did not imagine — because the reader **skipped**
  what it did not understand, and a reader that skips cannot be patched into one
  that refuses.

  The config is now parsed by **PyYAML** (`yaml.safe_load`, never `yaml.load`) behind
  a **closed schema**, in one loader (`tools/delegate/_machine_config.py`) that returns
  exactly `absent`, `parsed`, or `malformed` and never raises. `tools/delegate/_common.py`
  and `tools/adlc/forge_config.py` are both adapters over it, so a multi-section config
  can no longer lock one consumer out by the other's rule.

  **Shapes that used to be ignored and are now refusals** — every one of them
  previously fell through to legacy-key continuity and **granted** delegation against
  a written `enabled: false`. They are registered as named parity divergences D6–D11
  against the frozen pre-REQ-603 gate, so each is a measured fact and not a claim:

  | input | before | after | id |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | a directory at the config path | `0 ok` | `1 disabled-via-config` | D6 |
  | `delegate:  # settings` (comment on the header) | `0 ok` | `1 disabled-via-config` | D7 |
  | `ADLC_CONFIG=/dev/null` (BUG-205's shape) | `0 ok` | `1 disabled-via-config` | D8 |
  | a second `enabled:` key under `delegate:` | `0 ok` | `1 disabled-via-config` | D9 |
  | a BOM before the header | `0 ok` | `1 disabled-via-config` | D10 |
  | `enbaled: false` (an unknown key) | `0 ok` | `1 disabled-via-config` | D11 |

  Also refused now: a non-boolean `enabled` (`"false"` is the *string*, which Python
  treats as true), any nested mapping under `delegate:`, a repeated key **anywhere**
  in the document (the refusal names the key and its line, and is whole-document —
  one loader gives one verdict), a non-regular file at the path with no carve-outs, a
  dangling symlink, undecodable bytes, and a file over the **64 KiB** cap. The cap is
  unconditional, because a truncated YAML document can still parse. The 24-row
  well-formed matrix shows **zero** new divergence, and a config carrying only a
  `forge:` section still grants — the benign path a fail-closed change needs.

  What is *not* a refusal: an empty file, or one holding only comments. It parses to a
  null document and reads as **unconfigured**, exactly like a mapping with no
  `delegate:` key. An operator who created the file and wrote nothing has not opted
  out, and anyone able to truncate it could equally have written `enabled: true`.

  A **differential oracle** now compares the adapter against `yaml.safe_load` itself —
  a second implementation — over the reviewers' seeded shape corpus and 864 generated
  documents, so the suite is no longer bounded by one author's imagination.

  **The shell resolver asks the filesystem.** REQ-603 rejected binary resolution that
  came back as a bare name, which closed shell functions and aliases — and the hash
  table still handed the corpus to a planted binary, because `hash -p` answers with an
  absolute path. That closed a mechanism, not a class: any answer sourced from the
  shell's own lookup machinery inherits every table that machinery consults. The gate
  now walks `$PATH` itself, skips every entry that does not begin with `/`, and takes
  the first executable *regular file* named `adlc-read`; `timeout(1)` comes from a
  fixed list of absolute paths and never from `$PATH`, because a wrapper sees — and
  can replace — the binary it wraps. `command -v` appears nowhere in the gate, and the
  shell harness proves it under `sh`, `bash`, and `zsh`.

  **Call sites carry no second resolver.** Every delegated-invocation fence dropped its
  bare-name default and now refuses an empty `ADLC_READ_BIN` before any transmission —
  skills by exiting non-zero, `agents/delegate-pre-pass.md` (whose contract forbids a
  non-zero exit) by degrading into its sanctioned empty-candidates object. A new
  `lint-skills` check, **`read-bin-fallback`**, rejects the retired
  `"${ADLC_READ_BIN:-adlc-read}"` shape so it cannot rot back in.

  **One managed interpreter.** The `adlc` shim written by `install.sh` now prefers
  `~/.claude/delegate-venv/bin/python3` when it exists, falling back to `$PATH`'s
  `python3` otherwise, so both config consumers run where PyYAML is pinned. `adlc
  doctor` gains a **`pyyaml`** check reporting whether it imports in the interpreter
  `adlc` actually runs under, with a copy-pasteable fix. `pyyaml` is pinned in
  `tools/delegate/requirements.txt` (floor `>=6.0`, pinned at the tested `==6.0.3`).
  The import is lazy, so `--help` never pays for it; the probe's measured cost went
  from a 21.2 ms median to 25.5 ms, which is 0.004% of a 104-second delegated step.

  **Migration.**
  - **Re-run `./install.sh --with-delegation`** (or `bash tools/delegate/install.sh`)
    to get PyYAML into the venv. Without it the loader reports
    `malformed / dependency-missing`, one stderr line names the package, and the
    delegate CLIs **fail closed** — a partial install never falls through to "no
    config found". `/proceed`'s PR operations are the one carve-out: `forge_config`
    treats that single reason as unconfigured after the same stderr line.
  - **A config that relied on one of the fail-open shapes above now refuses**, with a
    named reason and the path — and, for a duplicate key, the key and its line. If a
    machine that used to delegate now reports `disabled-via-config`, run
    `adlc-read --print-gate` and fix the file the message names; the refusal
    deliberately does **not** advise setting `ADLC_DELEGATE_ENABLED=1`, because an env
    var cannot lift an arm the file just failed.
  - Consumer repos with a vendored `.adlc/partials/delegate-gate.sh` predating this
    REQ keep working (the pre-REQ-609 resolution behaviour) until `/init` re-vendors;
    `/template-drift` reports the stale copy.

- **The delegation gate may veto; only Python may authorize (REQ-603).** ⚠️ **Upgrade
  the gate and `adlc-read` together.**

  The opt-in predicate was implemented twice — in `partials/delegate-gate.sh` and in
  `_common.delegation_enabled` — and checked by two disjoint suites. That duplication
  produced two data-governance defects, one per arm shell decided: **BUG-205** (a shell
  fast path silently overrode a written `enabled: false` and transmitted) and
  **BUG-209** (`ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE` existed in shell and nowhere in Python, so both
  CLIs ignored the documented emergency stop). Each fix corrected the arm that had just
  failed; neither removed the condition that lets the next one drift.

  The gate now makes exactly two decisions, and **both can only withhold** delegation:

  1. binary resolution → `2 no-binary`
  2. the `ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE` veto → `1 disabled-via-env`, with **zero forks**

  Everything that could *grant* delegation resolves in one `adlc-read --print-gate`
  call, which prints `<enabled> <reason>` and exits 0 on every path — it reports, it
  never refuses. The gate validates the reason against the frozen enum and fails closed
  on anything else.

  The veto stays duplicated **on purpose**: a veto can only return *disabled*, so the
  copies agree or abstain but cannot contradict — provided Python recognises at least
  every input the shell does. Both test the literal `"1"`, and `test_cross_layer_veto.py`
  drives both layers over one input vector so widening either alone fails. Widening the
  shell veto alone is exactly how BUG-209 would return.

  **Five named behaviour changes, all fail-closed.** None makes the gate grant delegation
  it previously withheld:

  | input | before | after | rc |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `enabled: false`, no legacy key | `not-opted-in` | `disabled-via-config` | unchanged |
  | key VALUE in `api_key_env` | `not-opted-in` | `disabled-via-config` | unchanged |
  | opt-in satisfied, key var unset | `ok` | `disabled-via-config` | **0 → 1** |
  | config exists but unreadable | `ok` | `disabled-via-config` | **0 → 1** |
  | `--print-enabled`, unreadable config + legacy key | prints `1` | prints `0` | output |

  The first corrects a label that depended on an unrelated variable — the pre-REQ helper
  never read `enabled`, reporting `disabled-via-config` only when a config file existed
  *and* a legacy key happened to be set.

  ⚠️ The last one is a **security fix**. An unreadable or unparsable config previously
  returned an empty result indistinguishable from *no config*, falling through to
  legacy-key continuity — so an operator who wrote `enabled: false` on a machine with a
  stale key exported delegated anyway. That is BUG-205's reported outcome via a read
  failure rather than a precedence bug. A config that exists but cannot be read is now a
  refusal, not a default. If you rely on delegation and see `disabled-via-config`
  unexpectedly, check that your config is readable.

  **Migration:** an `adlc-read` predating `--print-gate` makes the gate fail closed —
  delegation off, safely but silently, reported as `not-opted-in`. `--print-enabled` is
  frozen and unchanged for callers that predate this.

### Fixed

- **The conflict-halt contract now says who may resolve, and bounds it to what a machine can
  check (BUG-207).** Two contract lines bore on a runner's own Phase 7/8 conflict, written for
  different actors: `/proceed`'s "stop and ask the user" (solo — a human is present) and REQ-485
  BR-4's "always human-resolved" (written about the orchestrator's unblock pass, inside the
  paragraph about that pass). Neither settled the case that actually occurs — a runner in an
  unattended `/sprint` whose sibling merged mid-batch, colliding at an append point in
  `CHANGELOG.md` or `partials/tests/run.sh`. Two of three runners hit one in a single sprint
  and resolved it; a rule that halts on every one turns an unattended batch into a
  babysitting job, which is what REQ-485 exists to prevent.

  The rule now turns on **who is present**, not how the conflict looks. Solo `/proceed`:
  halt and ask, unchanged. Under `/sprint`: the runner may resolve **if and only if** every
  conflicted hunk is both sides purely adding lines at the same point — a checkable property
  (with diff3 markers, every base section is empty), not a judgment; "looked mechanical"
  never qualifies. New `partials/conflict-bound.sh` checks it (`adlc_conflict_append_only`),
  resolves keep-both (`adlc_conflict_keep_both`, which re-checks and refuses otherwise), and
  **verifies** every contributed line survived against a sidecar it does not trust itself to
  have written correctly (`adlc_conflict_verify_kept`). Anything else — a modified line, a
  deletion — aborts and halts `blocked` as before. The resolution is recorded in
  `conflictsResolved` (BUG-212) before anything else happens, so the bound is auditable and
  a future decision to tighten it is measurable. `partials/tests/conflict-bound.test.sh`
  proves the classifier on positive, negative, mixed, and no-conflict fixtures under bash,
  zsh, `/bin/sh` and dash — including the exact `run.sh` harness-list collision that
  motivated the bound, where keep-both is the only resolution that cannot silently retire a
  test harness. The orchestrator's unblock pass is unchanged and still never resolves (BR-4).

- **A conflict resolved mid-run is now on the record (BUG-212).** When a pipeline run
  encountered a merge or rebase conflict and resolved it, nothing durable said so — not
  `pipeline-state.json`, not the PR, not the merge record. The only trace was the runner's
  closing narrative, written at its discretion. On the 2026-08-31 three-REQ sprint two
  runners resolved append-point conflicts and volunteered it; a runner that said nothing
  would have left a batch indistinguishable from one that hit no conflicts. And the failure
  mode is silent: one of those conflicts was a both-sides-append on `partials/tests/run.sh`'s
  harness list, where taking one side would have retired a whole test harness with every
  downstream check still green — a harness that is no longer enumerated does not fail, it
  ceases to exist.

  `pipeline-state.json` gains an additive, optional `conflictsResolved` array, appended
  **at the moment of resolution, before the pipeline continues** — not in the close-out,
  so a runner that crashes after resolving still leaves the record. Each entry carries the
  phase, files, who resolved it (`runner` \| `user` \| `orchestrator`), the strategy
  (`both-sides-append` when that is literally what happened), and an honest `verified`
  flag with how. Nothing reads it for control flow — which is exactly why it was never
  written. `/status` gains a **Conflict Resolutions** section over every spec's state
  file. The `/sprint` unblock pass appends nothing, because it never resolves (REQ-485
  BR-4); a clean auto-rebase is not a resolution. Deliberately **not** a gate on whether a
  runner may resolve — that is BUG-207's question; this only guarantees that if it did, it
  is on the record, which is what makes that decision measurable.

- **The delegate CLIs no longer return — or write — a truncated completion as a whole
  one (BUG-213).** ⚠️ **Both `--max-tokens` defaults changed, and a run that hits the cap
  now exits non-zero.** `adlc-read` defaulted to 8192 and `adlc-write` to 16384, set
  independently for a model whose whole budget was output. On the current default model
  `max_tokens` covers reasoning *and* output, and `kimi-k2.6` spends most of it reasoning
  first — measured 2026-09-03, an exhaustive read spent 6885 of 8192 reasoning and a
  test-module generation spent 14706 of 16384. `complete()` raised only on *empty*
  content and never read `finish_reason`, so a run that hit the cap with output already
  emitted was returned as complete: a plausible, well-formed, partial answer the caller
  could not tell from a whole one. On the write path that partial file was written to
  `--target` under `wrote:`, and under `--force` it replaced a good file.

  Both defaults are now **20000**, from one constant (`_common.DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS`).
  That clears every draw measured — but the reasoning cost of an identical request varied
  ~2x across runs (7880–14706 tokens), so no fixed number clears every draw possible, and
  the number is not what fixes this. `complete()` now reads `finish_reason`: a `length`
  finish is a **failure** whether or not content was emitted — the partial output is
  discarded, and the message names the cap, the characters emitted before the cutoff, and
  the reasoning-token count when reported. Any other finish with empty content names the
  reason the API returned instead of asserting `increase --max-tokens`, which the old
  message did for every cause. `tools/delegate/tests/test_complete.py` pins each case,
  including the one that matters: `length` **with** content must raise.

- **Partial sourcing is guarded — an absent repo-local copy no longer kills the block
  under POSIX `sh` (REQ-610).** ⚠️ **Re-sync `.adlc/partials/` per file: `/template-drift`
  will report six vendored partials as `stale`, and two of them carry executable fixes.**

  Every two-level call site was written `. <local> 2>/dev/null || . <canonical>` — dot-source
  the repo-local `.adlc/partials/<name>.sh`, fall back to `~/.claude/skills/partials/` when
  that fails. Under bash and zsh a failed `.` is an ordinary non-zero status and the `||` arm
  fires. Under POSIX `sh` it is not: `.` is a **special built-in**, and POSIX requires a
  non-interactive shell to *exit* when a special built-in fails (XCU 2.8.1). Under `dash`, and
  under `bash` in posix mode — which is what macOS ships as `/bin/sh` — the fallback was never
  reached, and the `2>/dev/null` made the death silent. Observed 2026-09-01: the `/architect`
  Step 5 footprint block, run with `sh` in a checkout with no `.adlc/partials/`, died at its
  first line and published nothing; the identical block under `zsh` worked. The executor shell
  for skills is zsh (LESSON-329), so this was latent there — but `partials/tests/run.sh` already
  re-runs every harness under `/bin/sh`, and any consumer or CI job that runs a fence under `sh`
  hit it.

  There is now exactly **one** canonical spelling, on a single line:

  ```sh
  if [ -f .adlc/partials/<name>.sh ]; then . .adlc/partials/<name>.sh; else . ~/.claude/skills/partials/<name>.sh; fi
  ```

  It is the only one of the four candidate forms correct under all of `/bin/sh` (macOS),
  `dash`, `bash`, `bash --posix`, and `zsh`. `command .` is **not** a fix — macOS `/bin/sh`
  still exits. `[ -f A ] && . A || . B` is not one either: when the repo-local copy exists and
  its last command returns non-zero, the canonical copy is sourced *on top of* it, inverting the
  repo-local-first precedence LESSON-441 depends on. No `2>/dev/null` survives, so a syntax
  error inside a vendored copy — or a canonical copy missing on a machine without the toolkit —
  now reaches stderr naming the path. The executable-partial `!`-macro (`sh … || sh …`) is
  unaffected and unchanged: `sh <file>` is an ordinary command, so it fails with exit 127, never
  fatally.

  `tools/lint-skills` gains an **`unguarded-source`** check so the spelling cannot drift back
  (LESSON-012): inside a ` ```sh `/` ```bash `/` ```shell ` fence, any statement-position `.` of
  a `partials/<name>.sh` path that is not the canonical spelling is a finding, and the retired
  shape is rejected **anywhere** in a walked file, prose included — prose that instructs the
  agent to type the line is as executable as a fence. `partials/tests/source-guard.test.sh`
  executes the real lines extracted from the real files under every shell `run.sh` drives, so
  the lint and the harness cannot disagree about what the corpus says.

  **Re-syncing.** Six partials changed — `attribution.sh`, `emit-step-telemetry.sh`,
  `forge.sh`, `id-alloc.sh`, `id-recheck.sh`, `trial-merge.sh` — so `/template-drift` will list
  those vendored `.adlc/partials/*.sh` as `stale` (`delegate-gate.sh`, `delegate-tools-path.sh`,
  `ethos-include.sh`, `intake.sh` are untouched). That is expected, not a regression. Note that
  on a root which also carries `tools/lint-skills` (the toolkit repo, or a consumer that vendored
  the linter), `check.sh` now walks `.adlc/partials/*.sh` and goes **red** on the stale copies
  until the re-sync lands. Re-sync
  **per file and byte-for-byte** rather than trusting the summary — a partially-synced surface
  looks healthy (LESSON-465). **Two carry executable fixes** and are the files where staying
  stale still behaves differently under `sh`: `emit-step-telemetry.sh` (its live self-source of
  `delegate-tools-path.sh`) and `id-recheck.sh`, whose `adlc_recheck_id` sourced its sibling
  `id-alloc.sh` through a three-level `. A || . B || . C` chain spread over continuation lines —
  a shape no reader had noticed and that the new `dash` pass in `run.sh` found. `/proceed`
  Step 4 sources `id-recheck.sh` repo-local-first (LESSON-441), so a stale vendored copy keeps
  dying at that chain under `sh`. `attribution.sh`, `forge.sh`, `id-alloc.sh`, and
  `trial-merge.sh` are header-comment updates only. The `SKILL.md` fences are not vendored —
  they reach every session on a symlink install the moment this lands.

- **`ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE=1` actually works now (BUG-209).** ⚠️ **Read this if you
  relied on it to halt delegation.** The documented emergency stop — "overriding
  everything including `ADLC_DELEGATE_ENABLED=1`" — was implemented **only** in
  `partials/delegate-gate.sh`. `delegation_enabled()` never read the variable, so
  `adlc-read` and `adlc-write` ignored it entirely: with it set, `--version` reported
  `enabled: true` and a real call printed the privacy notice, transmitted the corpus,
  and returned a completion.

  The gate is vendored per repo, so a stale `.adlc/partials/delegate-gate.sh` — or any
  direct CLI call — walked straight past the stop. This is the defect BUG-206 named and
  fixed one variable short: its own reasoning (*a governance control cannot live only in
  a layer that gets copied around*) applies verbatim, and its refusal message asserted
  "`ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE=1` forces it off regardless" — false in the file that printed
  it.

  The switch is now step 0 of the opt-in cascade, ahead of every other arm:

  0. `ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE=1` → **off, always**
  1. `ADLC_DELEGATE_ENABLED=1` → on
  2. `delegate.enabled`, when present → decisive both directions
  3. a legacy key, only when no config file exists → on
  4. otherwise → off

  Matching the shell's exact-`"1"` test, so the two layers cannot disagree about what
  counts as set — `"true"` and `"yes"` disable in neither. A refusal caused by the switch
  now names it rather than advising you to enable delegation you deliberately turned off.

  Why it survived this long: `partials/tests/delegate-gate.test.sh:114` asserts
  "ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE=1 beats everything" and passes — covering the vendored copy,
  the layer whose staleness *is* the threat model — while none of the 499 Python tests
  referenced the variable. The fixture that claims to clear "every delegate/legacy var"
  omitted it too, so a developer with it exported got different results from the same
  suite. Both are fixed; six of the seven new tests fail against the unfixed cascade.

- **The delegate CLIs now enforce `enabled` themselves (BUG-206).** `enabled` decides
  whether file contents may leave the machine, but until now it was consulted in exactly
  one place: `adlc-read --print-enabled`, the probe the shell gate calls. The path that
  actually transmits never looked at it.

  That made `partials/delegate-gate.sh` the sole enforcement — and that gate is
  **vendored per repo**, sourced ahead of the toolkit copy. A repo carrying a stale
  vendored gate called straight through a correct opt-out and the payload went out. It
  is what made BUG-205's blast radius every consumer repo rather than one file.

  `adlc-read` and `adlc-write` now refuse to transmit unless delegation is opted in,
  exiting non-zero with an actionable message, before any provider resolution or network
  touch. `--dry-run`, `--print-enabled`, and `--version` still work while disabled — a
  dry run sends nothing, and the probes are how a disabled setup gets diagnosed.
  Delegating skills already treat a non-zero exit as "fall back and read directly", so a
  refusal degrades exactly like a missing binary and no caller changes.

  Net effect: vendored-gate staleness is now a correctness problem rather than a
  data-governance one.

  Five pre-existing tests were corrected rather than accommodated — they set
  `ADLC_DELEGATE_BASE_URL` (deliberately not an opt-in signal under BR-11) and relied on
  reaching the exfiltration notice without opting in. Two of them would otherwise have
  kept passing **vacuously**, reporting "no notice" because the run was refused rather
  than because suppression worked.

- **The shipped default model is live again (BUG-208).** The provider retired
  `kimi-k2.5`, so every delegated call on the shipped defaults returned HTTP 404 —
  `adlc-read`, `adlc-write`, and every skill routing through them (`/spec` Step 1.6,
  `/wrapup` Step 4, `/analyze`, `/architect`, `/proceed` Phase 5) silently lost their
  cheap I/O tier and fell back to the primary model. The default is now `kimi-k2.6`,
  verified by live round-trip; a dated comment records the endpoint's current ids in
  place of one advertising `kimi-k2-thinking` and `kimi-k2-turbo-preview`, both also
  retired.

  Two things made this expensive to diagnose, and both are fixed:

  - **The failure had no handled path.** `complete()` caught empty content but not the
    SDK's HTTP errors, so a 404 escaped `main()` as a nine-frame traceback ending
    inside `site-packages/openai/` — the signature of a broken SDK or a bad key, which
    is not what happened. The provider's `or Permission denied` disjunction reinforced
    the misread. `APIStatusError` and `APIConnectionError` are now mapped to one
    actionable line each: 404 names the model and the three knobs that override it,
    401/403 points at `api_key_env`, 429 names quota. No traceback survives.
  - **The tests could not have caught it.** `test_resolve_provider.py` asserted that
    resolution *returns* `kimi-k2.5` — a tautology over the constant that stayed green
    after the id died. 283 delegate tests passed against a completely non-functional
    default. The assertions now follow the new value, which does not fix the underlying
    gap: nothing yet checks that the pinned default is one the endpoint still serves.
    Detection is filed as a follow-up on BUG-208 rather than bolted on here, since a
    naive liveness test would make the hermetic suite require a network and a funded key.

  A pinned external identifier is a fact about someone else's system, with an expiry
  date the toolkit does not track. If delegation starts failing with "model not found",
  re-run the endpoint's models list and re-pin — the key and the SDK are the usual
  suspects and are usually innocent (LESSON-334).

- **`delegate.enabled: false` is now honoured (BUG-205).** ⚠️ **Behavior change —
  read this if you rely on a legacy API key to enable delegation.**

  The BR-11 opt-in was a flat OR that tested the legacy-key arm *before* the config
  file, so an exported `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`/`KIMI_API_KEY` silently outranked an
  explicit `delegate.enabled: false`. The gate returned `ok`, `adlc-read --version`
  reported `enabled: true` against a config saying `false`, and file contents went to
  the configured third-party endpoint after the operator had written down that they
  must not. Since REQ-519 `install.sh` scaffolds a config containing exactly that
  line, this was the default posture of every install with a key in the environment.

  BR-11's continuity exception was written for *pre-config* installs — where
  `enabled` is **absent** — but was implemented as "not true", which also swallowed a
  written `false`. Absence is a default; `false` is an instruction.

  `enabled` now resolves in the same precedence order as the provider fields (BR-2),
  which it never previously followed:

  1. `ADLC_DELEGATE_ENABLED=1` → on
  2. `delegate.enabled`, when the key is **present** → decisive **in both directions**
  3. a legacy key, reached only when **no config file exists** → on
  4. otherwise → off

  `ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE=1` still forces off ahead of all of it.

  **Migration:** if your config carries the scaffolded `enabled: false` and you were
  relying on a legacy key to opt in, delegation is now **off**. Set `enabled: true`
  (or export `ADLC_DELEGATE_ENABLED=1`). `adlc-read --version` prints the resolved
  value. Installs with no config file are unaffected — continuity is preserved
  exactly where BR-11 meant it.

  Also in this fix:
  - New gate reason **`disabled-via-config`**, so telemetry distinguishes a
    deliberate opt-out from a machine that was never opted in. Callers that branch
    only on the 0/1/2 return code are unaffected; the 0/1/2 contract is unchanged.
  - The config probe is now **fail-closed on exit status as well as output**. Command
    substitution captures stdout and discards the exit code, so a probe that printed
    `1` and then failed was read as consent.
  - `partials/tests/delegate-gate.test.sh` — new harness (arm ordering, fail-closed
    posture, and assertions that the no-config path still never forks), registered in
    `partials/tests/run.sh` and run under both bash and zsh.
  - The `tools/delegate/README.md` opt-in section contradicted itself: it documented
    `absent/false => disabled` eleven lines below listing a legacy key as sufficient
    on its own. Both halves are corrected, and the precedence table now states that
    `enabled` follows it.

- **`tools/lint-skills` no longer passes a scan that checked nothing (REQ-595).**
  REQ-435 fixed the vacuous *walk* — a scan root sitting under `.worktrees` is no
  longer skipped into oblivion — but a root that genuinely contains no `SKILL.md`
  still produced zero findings and exited `0`: the same confident green, one layer
  down. The scanned-file count is now threaded out of `run()` (not recomputed, so
  it cannot drift from the files the checks actually saw), printed to stderr on
  every run, and a zero count exits **255**. The findings cap moves to **254** so a
  saturating findings run can never be mistaken for a vacuous one — POSIX statuses
  are 8-bit, so the distinct value is carved out of the top of the range rather
  than placed above it. `/analyze` Step 1.9 already treats a non-zero exit with no
  parseable output as non-blocking, so it now reports the dimension as unavailable
  instead of falsely clean.

  Two pre-existing skip-directory tests asserted only that *nothing was reported*
  over a root whose every `SKILL.md` was excluded — an assertion a wholly broken
  walker also satisfies. Both now stage a real in-root skill, so exclusion is
  proven with a demonstrably working walker.

### Fixed (post-5.1.0 defect sweep)

Backfilled 2026-08-30. These landed between 2026-06-12 and 2026-08-28 and were not
recorded at the time; PR numbers are `atelier-fashion/adlc-toolkit`.

- **`/template-drift` trusted an unverified canonical baseline (BUG-204, #127).**
  `~/.claude/skills` is a symlink to a **working checkout**, not a release artifact — it
  can sit on a feature branch, behind `origin/main`, or dirty — and whatever it contained
  was silently treated as canonical. A stale baseline does not weaken verdicts, it
  **inverts** them: a consumer carrying the *newer* file is reported `stale`, and Step 6
  then proposes copying the older baseline over it, so the skill drives a regression with
  full confidence. Observed 2026-08-28, when the checkout sat on a branch cut before
  BUG-201 merged and `infrastructure` — which correctly carried the fix — was reported as
  the stale one. New **Step 0a** resolves the real checkout via `readlink`, fetches,
  captures branch/default/dirty/behind, names the baseline in the report header *always*,
  and warns with the consequence spelled out. Prefers
  `git show origin/<default>:<path>` when the checkout is not clean-and-current;
  otherwise downgrades every `stale` to `unverified-baseline` rather than asserting drift
  the baseline cannot support.

- **`/template-drift` compared only the checked-out branch (BUG-203, #126).** In a
  `dev → staging → main` repo a vendored file is one thing *per branch*, and the branches
  disagree by design: a sync PR reaches `main` only at the next promotion, a promoted
  change reaches `dev` only at the next reverse-sync. Reading the working tree answered a
  question nobody asked, and answered it confidently — under-reporting being the exact
  failure this skill exists to prevent. Both directions were live on 2026-08-28: two
  repos were in sync on `staging` and stale on `main`, and were given sync PRs that had
  to be withdrawn; a third was stale on `dev` only and reported clean. New **Step 0**
  fetches, detects the integration branch using `/proceed` step 4's *existing* signals
  rather than a second rule, enumerates the long-lived branches that actually exist, and
  reads per branch with `git show`, degrading to working-tree-only (and saying so in the
  header) when there is no git or remote. New **Step 3e** folds per-branch results into
  one verdict — `clean`, `needs-sync`, `pending-promotion`, `needs-reverse-sync`,
  `regression`, `partial-missing`, `uncommitted` — each routed to its correct remedy.
  Two rules the old skill could not express: never propose a sync PR for
  `pending-promotion` (the commit exists; the gap is a promotion), and never propose a
  plain squash PR for `needs-reverse-sync` (ancestry is the reverse-sync script's
  idempotency check). The report is now a surface × branch matrix, and proposed actions
  name their PR base.

- **The forge classifier had no pattern for branch-protection merge refusals (BUG-201,
  #125).** `_adlc_forge_classify` reported them as `error_class=network` — the one class
  that reads as transient and invites a retry, when the real fix is to update the head
  branch and wait for checks to re-report. The classifier substring-matches backend
  stderr with `network` as its **fall-through default**, so an unknown signature does not
  fail loudly; it silently acquires the least actionable class. Its policy arm matched
  only `policy` / `branch protection` / `blocked` / `not mergeable` / `TF402455`, none of
  which are words GitHub's `mergePullRequest` refusals use. Never a GitHub-only defect:
  both backends share the classifier, and Azure DevOps completion refusals say
  "policies" — plural, which `*"policy"*` does not match. Adds a second, **purely
  additive** `merge-blocked-by-policy` arm (the pre-existing pattern set is byte-unchanged,
  so no previously-correct classification can regress), placed after `auth-missing` and
  `pr-not-found` per the documented most-specific-first ordering. Note that
  `You're not authorized to push to this branch` is a *policy* refusal, not
  `auth-missing`: the credential is fine, the permission is the point. Also names
  `local-git` in the BR-4 contract line, in `forge.md`, and in the mock scenario
  dispatcher — BUG-150 added the class without updating any of them, so
  `ADLC_FORGE_MOCK_SCENARIO=local-git` came back as `network`. `forge.md` now documents
  that `network` is the fall-through and therefore the class to distrust. Regression
  coverage: §4b pins 18 real backend stderr strings to their classes with negative
  anchors, §4c is a doc-contract guard that fails if the classifier can emit a class the
  header does not name, §4d drives both classes through the whole `pr_merge` mock path.

- **`adlc_forge_pr_merge --delete-branch` downgraded a request to advice (BUG-195,
  #121).** It reported `state=MERGED`, returned 0, left the remote branch in place, and
  emitted a stderr sentence telling the caller to run `git push origin --delete <branch>`
  — placeholder unsubstituted, in a channel every caller parses for `key=value`. BUG-150
  had fixed the *reporting* of this partial success and deliberately left the outcome to
  the caller; no caller ever acted on it, and a grep across all six call sites found no
  handling of `warn=` at all. The trigger is the default agent topology (worktree +
  primary checkout on `main`), so essentially every merge from a worktree needed a manual
  step. The adapter now completes the remote deletion itself via `git push origin
  --delete`, which touches no local ref and is therefore immune to the worktree collision
  that breaks `gh`'s cleanup — idempotent (already-gone counts as deleted), never touches
  a fork head, never converts a merge into a failure. New normalized field
  `branch_deleted=<1|0|skipped-fork>` on both success paths whenever deletion was
  requested; `/bugfix` and `/wrapup` now branch on it. **Branch on the field, never on the
  `warn=` prose.**

- **`/spec` retrieval excluded the status the pipeline actually writes (BUG-194, #119).**
  Step 1.6 filtered the spec corpus to `approved` | `in-progress` | `deployed`. No
  toolkit skill writes `in-progress` or `deployed` — `/architect` writes `approved`, and
  `/wrapup` and `/proceed` Phases 6–8 write `complete`. Reader and writers overlapped on
  one transient value, so retrieval returned **0 of 42 specs in this repo and 11 of 543
  (2.0%) ecosystem-wide** — and reported it as a *cold start*, because the "nothing
  matched" and "everything was filtered out" strings were byte-identical. That is why it
  hid for four months. The allowlist becomes an exclusion list (`draft`, `superseded`,
  `cancelled`, `rejected`), admitting 506/543 (93.2%) — the 37 excluded being exactly the
  withdrawn and unvalidated specs; the bug corpus gains `closed`. New sub-step 1a warns
  when a non-empty corpus is fully removed by the status filter and records it in
  `## Retrieved Context` instead of emitting the cold-start line. New
  `retrieval-status-parity` lint check compares `/spec`'s exclusion list against the
  statuses `/architect`, `/wrapup`, and `/proceed` declare, written so that removing or
  relocating a declaration is a finding rather than a silent pass. No data backfill:
  `complete` is what the pipeline writes, so the corpus was correct and the filter was
  wrong.

- **Phase 8's terminal state write lived only on the cross-repo path (BUG-193, #117).**
  It sat inside a block headed "Cross-repo merge sequencing", so a single-repo pipeline
  following the document literally merged its PR, claimed `merged`, and left
  `pipeline-state.json` saying the run never finished. Found by auditing 36 state files
  in one single-repo project: **12 disagreed with their own merged PRs.** Topology decides
  *who merges*, not *whether Phase 8 closes out*. `proceed/phases-6-8-ship.md` splits
  Phase 8 into 8a Merge / 8b Close out (both topologies) / 8c `pr-ready` reconciler, with
  8b reordered so the state write precedes worktree teardown and the primary checkout
  named as the write target; `agents/pipeline-runner.md` gains the single-repo close-out;
  `wrapup/SKILL.md` Step 3.5 writes all five fields rather than two. `/status` gains
  Stale Pipeline State detection so the failure stays visible even when an actor forgets.

- **`/wrapup` session-JSONL discovery mis-encoded `.` in worktree paths (BUG-152, #115).**
  Claude Code encodes a project path into a `~/.claude/projects/` directory name by
  replacing every non-alphanumeric character with `-`; the encoder replaced only `/`, so a
  session inside a harness worktree computed `-.claude-` where the real name is
  `--claude-` and never matched. The walk then reached the repo-root directory of older,
  unrelated sessions and "newest wins" silently delegated one of those. Now encodes with
  the real rule (fork-free, via parameter expansion), tries exact match first and falls
  back to a normalized scan against the real listing, starts the walk at the working tree,
  and **refuses** when a REQ id was available and no candidate mentions it rather than
  serving an arbitrary transcript — "newest wins" applies only when there is no anchor to
  check against.

- **`gh pr merge`'s exit code was treated as evidence (BUG-150, #113).** `gh pr merge`
  does two independent things — the merge API call and a local tidy-up — and exits
  non-zero when only the *local* step fails. Three merges out of three on `teton-code`
  (PRs #32/#34/#35) landed successfully and were reported as failures. The trigger is the
  normal agent layout, not an edge case: the default branch checked out in another
  worktree while the session works from `.worktrees/`. Worse, the local git error matched
  no classifier pattern and fell through to `network`, inviting a retry against an
  already-merged PR, and because gh aborts cleanup at the failed step the source branch
  silently survived. On non-zero rc the GitHub arm now asks
  `gh pr view <ref> --json state`: if `MERGED`, report success and demote the captured
  error block to `warn_class=` so the diagnostics survive without the output claiming
  failure. The exit code is a claim; the PR state is the evidence.

- **Recheck probes did not self-identify (BUG-145, #105).** Two live false-positive
  instances of the LESSON-435 class: the reservation probe reported the allocator's *own*
  reservation ref as a collision, so every `/bugfix` and lesson recheck false-halted into
  a renumber treadmill; and the merged-artifact probe reported a REQ's *own* merged spec
  directory as a collision, firing on every fresh `/proceed` in the normal
  spec-merges-first flow. `adlc_reserve_id` now records won pushes to an own-reservation
  ledger matched by exact object SHA, and `adlc_recheck_id` takes an optional
  own-artifact-name argument compared against same-number entries via a new `names` mode
  on the shared artifact scan. Missing ledger data degrades to the historical collision
  halt — the safe direction.

- **`adlc-read` was unreachable from GUI-launched sessions (#111).** GUI-launched Claude
  Code sessions inherit a `PATH` without `~/bin` (only `.zshrc` adds it), so the gate's
  bare `command -v adlc-read` returned no-binary on machines where `~/bin/adlc-read` is
  installed and working — the source of the persistent gate-fail telemetry. Adds
  `_adlc_resolve_read_bin()` (PATH first, then an executable `$HOME/bin/adlc-read`),
  exported as `ADLC_READ_BIN` at source time and re-resolved on every gate check; the
  delegated-invocation fences in `/spec`, `/proceed`, `/analyze`, `/wrapup`, and
  `agents/delegate-pre-pass.md` invoke `"${ADLC_READ_BIN:-adlc-read}"`, the bare-name
  default keeping stale vendored gate copies working.

- **Telemetry duration guard and `mktemp` portability (#107).** `emit-step-telemetry.sh`
  validates that `start_s` is all-digits before the duration arithmetic — an empty or
  non-numeric operand inside `$(( ))` is fatal in zsh, and missing or garbage marks now
  yield a duration of `-` instead of crashing `/spec` Step 1.6. `skill-flag.sh` uses a
  full-path `mktemp` template instead of `-t <name>`: BSD `mktemp` treats the `-t`
  argument as a literal prefix and never expands its `X`s.

### Knowledge

- **LESSON-626 — a rule written about one actor does not settle the case for another.**
  Ask *whose action* each contract sentence binds, and whether a human is present. A
  permission granted to a machine must be bounded by a property a machine can check —
  fixture-proven, with a benign path — and verified against evidence the resolving step did
  not produce. An audit record is written by the actor at the moment of the event, additive
  and optional, and read by nothing for control flow; it is what makes the permission
  measurable (BUG-207, BUG-212).
- **LESSON-625 — a completion cap on a reasoning model is a probability, not a ceiling.**
  Read `finish_reason`; never infer completeness from the content that came back — a
  `length` finish *with* content is the dangerous case, because nothing downstream can
  detect it. An identical request drew 7880–14706 reasoning tokens across three runs, so
  no fixed cap clears every draw. And a numeric default is a claim about the model
  generation it was set under: re-pinning the model expires it silently unless the re-pin's
  acceptance criteria re-derive it (BUG-213).
- **LESSON-575 — a squash merge destroys the second parent a promotion depends on.** A
  `staging → main` promotion in `admin-api` was merged with the reflexive
  `--squash --delete-branch` idiom. `deploy.yml` resolves the staging image tag via
  `git rev-parse --verify HEAD^2` — the merge commit's second parent, whose SHA tags the
  image in the staging Artifact Registry. A squash commit has one parent, so the lookup
  fell through to a fallback that substituted the squash commit's own SHA and the docker
  pull missed with `manifest unknown`. Records the decision table for which PR shapes need
  `--merge`, the `--delete-branch` corollary (on a promotion the head *is* the permanent
  branch, and `branch_deleted=1` is meaningless there), and the one-line check that
  reveals a repo's promotion convention before you merge. Noted honestly as a **latent
  trap rather than a live bug**: the adapter has no default merge method — it forwards
  `"$@"` — but its signature advertises only `[--squash]` and four skill call sites
  hardcode it, none of which merges a promotion today.

- **LESSON-581 — a classifier's fall-through default is a claim about every input it has
  never seen.** `network` is a *diagnosis* ("this was transient, retry"), and making it
  the `*)` branch silently attached that diagnosis to every message the pattern set had
  not been taught. Prefer an honest `unclassified`; where a default must be a real class,
  pin the alternatives in a fixture table, because nothing in the code can detect that the
  patterns stopped covering the backend's wording.

- **LESSON-582 — bash 3.2 cannot parse a `case` inside `$( )`.** It reads the case
  pattern's `)` as the closing `)` of the substitution. Verified: syntax error on bash
  3.2.57 (macOS `/bin/bash` and `/bin/sh`), fine on bash 5.3.15, zsh 5.9, and dash. The
  sharper half is the failure's *direction*: Ubuntu CI runs bash 5 and would have gone
  green, and the zsh pass of `run.sh` was clean too — only the old local bash caught it.
  A parse error is total, so the suite aborted mid-run while still printing a healthy wall
  of `PASS` lines, and grepping that output for `FAIL` showed a clean bill of health.

- **LESSON-572 — a remediation is only real if its audience can execute it.** BUG-150
  correctly diagnosed gh's partial-success merge and fixed the reporting, then handed the
  leftover cleanup to "the caller" as an English sentence with an unsubstituted
  `<branch>` placeholder, in a channel every caller parses for `key=value`. Give each fact
  in a partial success its own normalized field, and finish the half you are able to
  finish.

- **LESSON-571 — a retrieval filter is half of a read/write contract.** Enumerate the
  actual writers of the field you filter on rather than the values you imagine; prefer an
  exclusion list over an allowlist for recall-oriented filters; and never let "nothing
  matched" and "everything was filtered out" render the same string.

- **LESSON-553 — shared post-work stranded on one branch of a fork.** The BUG-193 root
  cause generalized: work that both topologies owe must not live inside a block headed
  with one topology's name.

- **Also captured:** LESSON-434–439 (REQ-545/546 sprint knowledge), LESSON-440 (detectors
  need benign-path acceptance criteria), LESSON-441 (vendored partials shadow canonical
  fixes), LESSON-465 (verify vendored-surface sync per file; worktree chore branches),
  LESSON-471 + ASSUME-001 (REQ-553 wrapup knowledge), LESSON-478 (an exit code is a claim,
  an outcome is the evidence), LESSON-483 (a detected miss must refuse, not guess).

## [5.1.0] — 2026-06-12

The **de-brand drop** — completes REQ-515's genericization so a fresh adopter installs
nothing Kimi-named, fixes the inert delegation telemetry, and lands the four sibling REQs
and two zsh fixes of the same 12-June sprint. Tagged retroactively on 2026-09-03 at the
drop's last commit, `df5e747` (#100):

- **REQ-522** De-brand the delegation surface + single-fence-safe telemetry:
  - `tools/kimi/` → `tools/delegate/`; the legacy `kimi-gate.sh` / `kimi-tools-path.sh`
    source-through partials are deleted (callers use the canonical `delegate-*`);
    `KIMI_TOOLS` → `DELEGATE_TOOLS`.
  - The `ask-kimi` / `kimi-write` CLI shims are **removed** — use `adlc-read` /
    `adlc-write`. `ADLC_DISABLE_KIMI` is no longer an accepted flag (only
    `ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE`). Legacy `KIMI_MODEL` / `KIMI_NO_WARN` env reads dropped
    (use `ADLC_DELEGATE_MODEL` / `ADLC_DELEGATE_NO_WARN`). The `KIMI_API_KEY` /
    `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` **key** env vars remain (continuity, data).
  - The launchd LaunchAgent is renamed (`com.adlc-toolkit.kimi-setenv` →
    `…delegate-setenv`); the installer **migrates** an existing Kimi agent (unload old,
    load new) and removes the legacy venv/shims on upgrade.
  - **Telemetry fix (adversarial finding C1, critical):** the per-step delegation
    telemetry in `spec`/`proceed`/`wrapup`/`analyze` set shell state in one fenced block
    and read it in another, so every run recorded `mode=fallback, gate=fail` and the
    ghost-skip detector was unreachable. State is now persisted to the flag-file sidecar
    (`skill-flag.sh mark`/`read`) and resolved by the shared `_adlc_emit_step_telemetry`;
    `delegated` and `ghost-skip` are now correctly emitted. Telemetry schema is unchanged
    — old log lines still parse in `check-delegation.sh`.
  - `lint-skills` gains a `cross-fence-var` check (a non-exported var assigned in one
    fence and read in another) and a `grep -ri kimi` brand-creep guard test.

  **Migration table** (old → new):

  | Old | New |
  |-----|-----|
  | `tools/kimi/` | `tools/delegate/` |
  | `partials/kimi-gate.sh` | `partials/delegate-gate.sh` |
  | `partials/kimi-tools-path.sh` | `partials/delegate-tools-path.sh` |
  | `$KIMI_TOOLS` | `$DELEGATE_TOOLS` |
  | `ask-kimi` / `kimi-write` | removed — use `adlc-read` / `adlc-write` |
  | `ADLC_DISABLE_KIMI` | `ADLC_DISABLE_DELEGATE` |
  | `KIMI_MODEL` | `ADLC_DELEGATE_MODEL` |
  | `KIMI_NO_WARN` | `ADLC_DELEGATE_NO_WARN` |
  | `com.adlc-toolkit.kimi-setenv` | `com.adlc-toolkit.delegate-setenv` |
  | `~/.claude/kimi-venv` | `~/.claude/delegate-venv` |
  | `KIMI_API_KEY` / `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` | unchanged (key continuity, data) |

- **REQ-523** Id-alloc remote-derivation integrity: the remote high-water is derived from
  independent sources, the degraded signal actually fires when the remote is unreachable
  (instead of silently allocating from local alone), and the artifact scan is forge-aware.
- **REQ-524** `adlc renumber` is id-boundary-safe — `REQ-12` no longer rewrites `REQ-123`;
  the same-day follow-up audit (#99, below) removed the last bare `grep REQ-xxx` in `/sprint`.
- **REQ-525** `/template-drift` covers every vendored sync surface: `ETHOS.md` and the
  workflow runtime join templates and partials, so a stale principle or engine is reported
  rather than assumed synced.
- **REQ-526** Context-doc truth pass and `/map` disposition — the *Removed* and *Fixed*
  subsections below.
- **BUG-116** (#88) zsh-safe candidate-list iteration in the id allocator's remote
  high-water — the first of two same-class word-splitting defects fixed in this drop.

- **`run.sh`'s harness list did not survive zsh (BUG-118, #97).** Iterates harnesses via
  positional parameters instead of an unquoted `$TESTS` string, and re-execs `run.sh`
  under each shell so its own zsh invocation is exercised on every run. Same class as
  BUG-116 (LESSON-329/335 zsh executor, LESSON-399 single-element masking).


- **Boundary-free artifact-id matching sweep (#99, REQ-524 follow-up).** Fixes the
  `/sprint` eligibility example, whose bare `grep REQ-xxx` matched prefix siblings, and
  documents why `id-alloc`/`id-recheck` extraction plus exact-compare is already
  prefix-sibling safe.


- **Test portability off GitHub and outside the delegate venv (#100).**
  `test_cli_resolve_provider` asserted `github` against the checkout's own `origin`,
  failing on Azure DevOps and mirror clones; it now resolves against a synthetic repo with
  a GitHub remote, with `ADLC_CONFIG` neutralized so a machine config cannot override. The
  two `test_get_client_*` tests `importorskip("openai")` so they skip with a reason rather
  than erroring when the delegate venv deps are absent.


### Removed

- **`/map` skill removed from the distribution (REQ-526).** `/map` regenerated the
  `atelier-map` Obsidian vault and was hardcoded to the `atelier-map` repo and the
  Atelier sibling repos under `~/Documents/GitHub` — a project-specific skill that
  has no meaning for any other adopter and violated the "skills must work for any
  consumer project" rule in a stack-agnostic distribution. It was undisclosed in the
  README catalog and reached `~/.claude/skills/` only because `install.sh` symlinks
  the whole repo root.

  **Migration / tombstone:** `/map`'s functionality is not deleted, only un-distributed.
  Relocate it to the atelier project's own skill directory (or a personal
  `~/.claude/skills/` entry outside this repo). The full `map/SKILL.md` body is
  recoverable from git history at the REQ-526 removal commit. No consumer project
  references `/map` by name in its own automation, so the removal is non-breaking for
  the distribution.

### Fixed (context-doc truth pass, REQ-526)

- Corrected every "five principles" claim in `architecture.md`, `conventions.md`, and
  `project-overview.md` — ETHOS.md has seven principles; rephrased to a count-free
  "the ETHOS principles".
- Rewrote `project-overview.md` to describe the current tree truthfully (the toolkit
  tracks its own lessons and bugs; numbering is remote-derived per REQ-518; the 4.x
  and 5.0 epochs exist).
- Reordered this changelog's epoch summary list to read 1→5 in source order (the `4.x`
  and `5.x` bullets had been transposed).
- Completed the template enumerations in `README.md` and `architecture.md`
  (`taxonomy-template.md` was missing) and documented the `id-alloc.sh`/`id-recheck.sh`
  partials in `partials/README.md`, dropping its stale "partial drift detection not yet
  implemented" claim.

## [5.0.0] — 2026-06-12

The **portability drop** — six REQs making the toolkit configurable for adopters
beyond the original machine, model, and forge:

- **REQ-515** Provider-agnostic delegation: `adlc-read`/`adlc-write` (Kimi names kept
  as shims), config-file provider resolution with strict precedence, delegation
  **disabled by default** on fresh installs, key-in-config refusal (#80).
- **REQ-517** New **`/adversary` skill** + dedicated `adversary` agent (18th):
  adversarial review of any artifact with mandatory self-refutation (#79).
- **REQ-519** **One-command `install.sh`** + **`adlc` umbrella CLI** with `doctor`
  (12 environment checks, copy-pasteable remediations, pure stdlib) (#82).
- **REQ-516** Configurable **agent model tiers**: `tier:` classes on all 18 agents,
  `adlc agents render` from config, drift detection in lint-skills (#83).
- **REQ-518** **Collision-safe ID allocation** across users/machines: remote-derived
  high-water via shared `id-alloc`/`id-recheck` partials, `adlc renumber` (#84).
- **REQ-520** **Forge adapter**: all PR operations behind `partials/forge.sh` with
  GitHub (`gh`), Azure DevOps (`az repos`), and mock backends — GitHub↔ADO is a
  one-line `forge:` config change or pure auto-detect (#85).
